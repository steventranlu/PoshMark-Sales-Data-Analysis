# PoshMark-Sales-Data-Analysis

Hello. Welcome to my Github. 

This is an analysis done on my e-commerce platform where I sell second-hand items. 
The object of the analysis is to create insightful actions to improve online sales
and to create more click-through rates on my e-commerce.

First report was developed on R/RStudios. Future version developed on Python.

Additional analysis completed on 08/06/2020 using Python.
